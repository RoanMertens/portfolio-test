      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I have been studying Ruby and Rails intensively for the past 5 months,
      both on the 9-week Le Wagon RoR bootcamp and alongside my personal and
      commercial projects since the course finished in September.
      I have studied Ruby along with OOP practices, and with Rails have
      employed MVC architecture and ActiveRecord. I am very comfortable
      with git and version control. In Javascript I have studied the vanilla
      language, and am hoping to refactor some ongoing projects in jQuery.</p>
